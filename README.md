## 🎯 Project goals
The primary goal of this project was to learn about **React Router**.

I realized that reloading the browser every time I changed pages would result in the loss of the application's state. 
Therefore, I researched ways to change pages without reloading the browser, and discovered React Router. 
Given its popularity, I decided to start learning it as quickly as possible.

I aimed to explore the various features of React Router and gain practical experience in implementing routing in a React application.
By doing so, I hoped to enhance my skills in frontend development and provide a seamless experience for the end-user.
